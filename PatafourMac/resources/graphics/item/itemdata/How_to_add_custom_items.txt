If you wish to add a custom spritesheet, export your spritesheet under 4 different resolution modes:
_L is exported at 640x360 resolution
_M is exported at 1280x720 resolution
_H is exported at 1920x1080 resolution
_U is exported at 3840x2160 resolution
Every spritesheet file contains an additional .spr file. This .spr file defines pixel bounds of each texture on the spritesheet. Refer to the main spritesheets to learn how it works.
In order to make your items a reality, head over to the resources/data/itemdata/ folder, add your items there and specify your custom spritesheet by it's name without the leading "_x" because that's only for different quality purposes.
